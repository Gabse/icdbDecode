# DXDesigner file format documentation

This project aims at understanding the file format of Siemens EDA (former Mentor Graphics) DXDesigner used in the Pads, Pads Plus and Xpedition design suite.

The research was inspirated by the icdb2fs project done by Patrick Yeon (https://github.com/patrickyeon/icdb2fs) in 2011.

All documentation is purely based on research and observations, no static or dynamic code analysis of proprietary executable files was used.
It's intend is to gain understanding of the file format, in order to allow interoperability with other EDA packages.

European copyright law explicitly allows reverse engineering as a legitime means of obtaining information about a unknown file format,
with the intend of establishing intercompatibility with other software packages.

There is no warranty of any sort on completeness, and correctness of the provided documentation.
