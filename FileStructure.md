# DXDesigner / xDXDesigner file format documentation

For those who don't know:
DX Designer / xDXDesigner operates on a design blocks concept, meaning your schematic pages grouped into blocks (called schematic in DXD), who are then instanced in the design itself.
Each block can consist of multiple pages (called sheets in DXD and groups in the file format), and can be instanced multiple times in a design. This makes it easy to reuse repeating schematic pages multiple times in a design.

# .prj file
DX Designer Projects have the file ending .prj, but no actual schematic data is stored inside that file.
The .prj file contains some metadata, and is divided into sections containing different configuration keys
The most important key is 'iCDBDir' in the 'iCDB' section. It defines where the actual schematic data is stored in the 'icdb.dat" file. This key is normally set to '.\database'.
Other important keys might link to the variant information’s file, the bus contents file, the used component library, and the borders configuration file, which are all stored separately.
It looks something like this:
```
SECTION iCDB
KEY iCDBDir ".\database"
ENDSECTION
```

# icdb.dat
This is the main schematics data file. It is a database, implemented as separate file system.
The files are stored in a file list format, and may consist of multiple data fragments. The data is either zlib compressed, or in plain text.
Please consult the Kaitai file 'icdb.ksy' for a detailed description of the binary database structure.
Using icdbDecode it is possible to extract the data and file structure of a given database.dat file, alongside additional metadata.

# database contents

# .v files
Most of the files inside a database have a .v ending, and contain a list of keys with their respective data payload. The data format is as follows:
- Length of key as 32bit (unsigned) integer.
- Key as string (char array) without zero termination
- Type-code as 32bit (unsigned) integer. The following type-codes are known:
	* `1`	-> String
	* `2`	-> Integer Array
	* `3`	-> UID (2 x 32bit / 64Bit)
	* `4`	-> SUID (4 x 32bit / 128Bit)
	* `5`	-> Int (1 x 32bit)
	* `6`	-> Long (2 x 32bit / 64Bit)
	* `7`	-> Time (3 x 32bit / 96Bit)
	* `8`	-> LongLong (4 x 32bit / 128Bit)
	* `13`	-> GUID (Format unknown, as there was never data present in any of my observations)

- Number of entry’s as (unsigned) integer.
	+ For all type codes except 1(string) and 2(int array) the number must be divided by 8 to obtain the number of entries.
	+ For type-code 1(string) the number is calculated the following way: Constant per entry plus sum of every string length (12 + number of characters rounded up to multiple of 4 per entry)
	+ For type-code 2(int array) the number is calculated the following way: Constant per entry plus sum of every int array length (8 + number of bytes per entry)
- Padding? (16 bytes, or 4 (unsigned) integers of value 0)
- Block Address? ((unsigned) integer number. Not sure what it is intended for)
- Payload Data.
	+ For all type codes except 1(string) and 2(int array) the data is located here, there are however some magic values with special functions:
		* `0x4FFFFFFF` -> This magic marks the end of the data section. It is followed by the length of the next key, or by a 0 for the last entry in a file.
		* `0x4FFFFFFE` -> Unknown function, but always followed wit another integer vaule that does not belong to the data payload.
						Probably change to another block address, with the value of the second value being the new address
		* `0x4FFFFFFD` -> Repeated value. This magic is always followed by the number of repetitions represented as unsigned integer value.
						The data from before the magic is always repeated n times. As such, this magic can probably not exist as first entry in the payload section.
						The number of repetitions is a negative value that is incremented until 0.
		* `0x4FFFFFFC` -> Increasing value. This magic is similar to the repeated value
						Instead of just repeating the value before the magic, the value is incremented by one in respect to the prior entry.
						It is unclear if and how this magic is present on type-codes other than 5(Int).
	+ For type-code 1(string) the first byte of every entry consists of a 8 bit string length value, followed by the string as a char array without zero termination.
		The string length value can also be one of the following magic keys:
		* `0xFF`	-> End of payload, the same as key `0x4FFFFFFF` in other type codes.
		* `0xFE`	-> Unknown function, probably the same as key `0x4FFFFFFE` in other type codes.
		* `0xFD`	-> Marks strings with more than 255 characters. This Key is followed by a (unsigned) integer as string length.
	+ For type-code 2(int array) the first entry of every array consists of (unsigned) integer length value, followed by the integer array payload.
	  Instead of the length, the same magic keys as for other types can be found, marking the data section end etc.
	  It is unclear if the magics for repeated and increasing value can also be present, and what they do.

This file contains a list of parameter.
Please consult the Kaitai file 'icdb_consdef.ksy' for a detailed description of the binary data structure.

# s- folders
Session folders?
For each session (from the sids file) there is a folder named 's' followed by the session index (s1, s2, s3, ...) in the root directory.
The session folders normally contain some of the following elements:

## cdbblks folder
(i)CDB Blocks folder?
This folder contains a sub-folder for each design block in the design.
The folder name is the block UID with a .blk suffix.
More information on the block folders, consult the *.blk folders chapter.


### *.blk folders
This folder normally contains the following files:
- dxdatl.v -> (DxD atlas?) Contains information about nets and graphical elements within a block page. A parser is currently under development.
- blkatl.v -> (Block atlas?) Contains general information about the block (Block Name, used components, border information...)

## cdbcatlg folder
(i)CDB component atlas folder?
This folder normally contains the following files:
- catlgatl.v -> (catalog atlas?) Contains general information’s about the project such as schematic pages, their UID and their names.
- grpatl.v -> (Group atlas?) Exact purpose currently unknown. Contains mainly timestamps.
- grpobj -> (Group object?) Contains information about what UIDs belong to group. See section "grpobj" for more information

### grpobj file
This file lists UIDs the corresponding group codes. It is used to assign the design elements to different sheets.
The format is the following:
0x0 - 0x1fff -> Unknown
after 0x2000:
	-> empty int (32 bit)
	-> Number of UID structures to follow as int (32 bit)
	list of UID structures:
